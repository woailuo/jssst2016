%% \section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstraction} In the previous work, we proposed a behavioral
type system for a programming language with dynamic memory allocation
and deallocation.  The behavioral type system, which uses sequential
processes as types where each action is related to an allocation and a
deallocation, can estimate an upper bound of memory consumption of a
program.  However, the previous type system did not deal with
path-sensitivity, which results in an imprecise abstraction even for a
simple program.  In order to address this problem, we propose an
extension of the previous type system with \emph{path-sensitive
behavioral types}.  Our extended type system can capture path-sensitive
behavior of a program, which enables more precise analysis of the
behavior of a program.

% We
% prove the soundness of the extended type system and propose a type
% inference algorithm of this type system.  We also implemented the
% algorithm.  Our experiment shows that the extended type system is very
% useful to deal with a practical path-sensitive program by checking
% whether the if-guard-part is a null pointer or not.
